# Why West Africa?

2019 is a special year for African Americans. It marks the 400th anniversary of the first Atlantic slave trip's arrival in Jamestown, Virginia in 1619. The majority of the slaves imported to the Americas in the next centuries are from African West Coast, from today's Senegal all the way down to today's Angola. Due to this historic connection, 2019 is a particularly meaningful time to visit West Africa, and that's why I'm going!


I'll spend my Thanksgiving week in Benin, Togo and Ghana, and visit some spots where slave trade once took place. In addition, I'll also explore several big cities and experience life in Africa today. Very excited about it :)
